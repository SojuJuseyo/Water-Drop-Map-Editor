# Water-Drop-Map-Editor

This is the Map Editor I developed in order to allow our team to easily create and design maps for our game "Water Drop Project". This game was made for our 2D Game course in Keimyung University, from September 2015 to June 2016.

The Editor uses technology such as C# .Net and WPF, when the game itself is developed in C++, using Dx11.

Even though the Map Editor is working as intended, there are still a lot of improvement possible as I was learning how to master WPF and C# while doing this project. The code is not as clean as I would like it to be. Nevertheless, I'm proud of what we were able to accomplish given the time we could spend on this project (Having 2-3 more course and school project didn't allow us to spend full time on this one).
